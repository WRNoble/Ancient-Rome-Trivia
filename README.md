# Ancient Roman Trivia Game

This project was done in accordance with General Assembly. The project was to make a trivia game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript had to influence the HTML through DOM manipulation. The game should keep score and respond when a user answer correctly or incorrectly.

## Getting Started

A user only needs access to github pages as well as an Internet connection in order to load and play the game.

## Instructions

The game should load the first question automatically. The user will type in the first answer and hit the submit button. The website will respond with whether or not the user answered the question correctly. The website will de-activate the submit button once all the questions have been answered. If a user wishes to play again they merely have to hit the reset button.

## Long Term Plans

I have really enjoyed this project, as a result, I have intentions of return to it to add additional functionality to the programing. I wish to expand the answer array to include multiple right answers. I also desire to allow the users get two chances to get the question right by providing a hint the first time an answer is incorrect. I would also like to spend more time on the CSS and probably center the items in the panel div. I also intend to create more than one version of this focusing on a different ancient civilization. I plan to revisit this project only this time build it out in React.js to allow for a smoother interface. In addition I want to build out an Express backend that can tracker players and scores.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I have encountered on this project so far is the allowing the possibility for more then one right answer. Initially, the questions I had more then one possible answer for would accept any answers the user submitted.

## Solution

I was able to remedy the problem by incorporating "else if" clauses into my conditional statement. this gave the function the ability to cycle through acceptable answers.

## Languages

This website is written in HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript and has been verified by both HTML and CSS validators.
